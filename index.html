      <div id="description">
        Dan is on a mission to share code with the world. (In a fun, approachable way.) On his YouTube channel, The Coding Train, he publishes "creative coding" tutorials with subjects ranging from the basics of programming languages like JavaScript (with p5.js) and Java (with Processing) to generative algorithms like physics simulation, computer vision, and data visualization. In his "spare time", he works as an Associate Arts Professor at the ITP / Tisch School of the Arts / NYU. He is a director of The Processing Foundation and the author of Learning Processing: A Beginner’s Guide to Programming Images, Animation, and Interaction and The Nature of Code, an open source book about simulating natural phenomenon with code.
